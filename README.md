# CVE-2021-44228_scanner (modified)
Applications that are vulnerable to the log4j [CVE-2021-44228](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44228) issue may be detectable by scanning jar, war, and ear files to search for the presence of `JndiLookup.class`.

Any file discovered is worth investigation to determine if the application using it is vulnerable. For any `JndiLookup.class` that is present, log4j commonly includes the version in the jar file name. For example, a hit on `log4j-core-2.14.1.jar` would be indicative of a vulnerable application. Alternatively, `log4j-core-2.16.jar` may also produce a hit because the JndiLookup code is still present in the 2.16 version of log4j, but it is disabled by default.  See [VU#930724](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/930724) for more details.

For example, here is an invocation of the PowerShell version of the scanner:
![checkjndi.ps1 execution on c:\\](checkjndi_ps1.png "checkjndi_ps1 execution on c:\\")

Locations to scan can be piped into the script to have control of what is checked.  For example, to scan a list of paths conatined in a the file `paths.txt`:

```
get-content .\paths.txt | .\checkjndi.ps1
```

Let's look at the first hit on our Windows scan execution:
```
C:\Users\unst0\Desktop\test_folder\apache-log4j-2.17.1-bin.zip contains apache-log4j-2.17.1-bin/log4j-core-2.17.1.jar contains org/apache/logging/log4j/core/lookup/JndiLookup.class ** BUT APPEARS TO BE PATCHED **
```
This jar file contains a 2.17 version of log4j, which is not vulnerable to CVE-2021-44228. This result is reported for information purposes, which shows that a vendor has patched their product.

Let's look at the second hit:
```
WARNING: C:\Users\unst0\Desktop\test_folder\ghidra_10.0.4_PUBLIC_20210928.zip contains ghidra_10.0.4_PUBLIC/Ghidra/Framework/Generic/lib/log4j-core-2.12.1.jar contains org/apache/logging/log4j/core/lookup/JndiLookup.class
```
Here we can see that Ghidra uses log4j version 2.12.1, and as such we should assume it to be vulnerable. And indeed, Ghidra versions before 10.1 are [vulnerable to CVE-2021-44228](https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra/releases/tag/Ghidra_10.1_build).

Let's look at the third hit:
```
WARNING: C:\Users\unst0\Desktop\test_folder\server.jar contains META-INF/libraries/org/apache/logging/log4j/log4j-core/2.14.1/log4j-core-2.14.1.jar contains org/apache/logging/log4j/core/lookup/JndiLookup.class
```

Here we can see that the minecraft server.jar file uses log4j version 2.14.1, and as such we should assume it to be vulnerable. And indeed, Minecraft: Java Edition server versions before 1.18.1 are [vulnerable to CVE-2021-44228](https://www.minecraft.net/sv-se/article/important-message--security-vulnerability-java-edition).

You should investigate any hits reported by either of these scripts, and confirm that either the log4j version is indeed the fixed 2.16 version, or reach out to your software vendor to obtain a fixed version of the software. Alternatively, [VU#930724](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/930724) has information about how `JndiLookup.class` can be removed from vulnerable jar files.
